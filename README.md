 Rotate Elements – Revit Plugin
Rotate Elements is a lightweight, user-friendly Revit plugin designed to help users quickly rotate structural or architectural elements by a specified angle directly within the active view.

This tool integrates seamlessly into the Revit ribbon, under a custom tab labeled "Elwahsh" and an "Edit" panel. Once triggered, it opens a simple WPF window that allows users to:

Input a rotation angle

Select multiple elements in the model

Apply the rotation around each element’s base point
